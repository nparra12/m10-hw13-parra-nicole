# ES6 Refactor

&nbsp;
## Background

For this assignment you're being tasked with converting the solution to the Weather Widget assignment from ES5 JavaScript to ES6+.

&nbsp;
## Setup

Please create a git repository titled `m10-hw13-lastname-firstname` and clone the repo to your computer. Copy the files from the `unsolved` folder into the root directory of your cloned repository. Write your code in the `index.js` file that has been provided.

There are tests included in this assignment. You can run the tests using the `index.html` file with the live server extension.

&nbsp;
## Instructions

Your assignment is to translate the ES5 JavaScript code in `index.js` to use ES6+ features. The application is functioning as is, and should function exactly the same when the assignment is completed. To aid your efforts, tests have been added to the application that cover all the critical features of the app.

When converting from ES5 to ES6+, you will need to do each of the following at least once:

1. Convert a `var` declaration to `const` or `let` where appropriate.
1. Convert a promise-based function (a function call with `.then`) to instead use `async/await`.
1. Convert a `function` declaration into a arrow function.
1. Convert a string concatenation to instead use template literals and string interpolation.
1. Convert some object-related code to use ES6 destructuring.

You are **NOT** required to convert the entire `index.js` file to use ES6, although you may if you wish. To receive full credit, you only have to use each of the above features once in your submission. All tests should pass to indicate no changes to functionality of the assignment.

To run the tests:

Click the "Run Tests" button in the bottom right corner of the web page. If you would like to run the tests again, reload the page and click the button again.

&nbsp;
## Deployment

Your code must be deployed to GitHub Pages. To deploy a repository to GitHub pages you must

1. Ensure your repository has an `index.html` file in the root directory.
1. Navigate to the `settings` section of the repository.
1. Click on `pages` in the left navigation menu.
1. Under `source` click the dropdown and select your `master` or `main` branch.
1. Click `save`.

Your site should be deployed to `<your github username>.github.io/<your repository name>` in 5-10 minutes.

&nbsp;
## Submission

Please submit both a link to your repository and a link to the live site. Also please include any comments on stumbling blocks or difficulties encountered while completing the assignment.
