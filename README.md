# ES6 Refactor

&nbsp;
## Background

For this assignment you're being tasked with converting the solution to the Weather Widget assignment from ES5 JavaScript to ES6+.



&nbsp;
## Instructions

Your assignment is to translate the ES5 JavaScript code in `index.js` to use ES6+ features. The application is functioning as is, and should function exactly the same when the assignment is completed. To aid your efforts, tests have been added to the application that cover all the critical features of the app.

When converting from ES5 to ES6+, you will need to do each of the following at least once:

1. Convert a `var` declaration to `const` or `let` where appropriate.
2. Convert a promise-based function (a function call with `.then`) to instead use `async/await`.
3. Convert a `function` declaration into a arrow function.
4. Convert a string concatenation to instead use template literals and string interpolation.
5. Convert some object-related code to use ES6 destructuring.

## Comments:
Deconstructing was the most difficult part of the project, took me the longest to complete the assignment.
